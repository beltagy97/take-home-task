I have used Vite for Frontend
Mantine UI, Tanstack Router, Tanstack Query adn typescript as they provide typesafety and easy to use with well documentation.
Also Tanstack tools provide really great devtools that can come handy and let you debug easier.


I have used for backend Express since I need to keep it as minimal as possible and lightweight.
I used layered architecture, however it does not have DI implemented in express. So I had to mimic Dependency Injecion.
I wrote tests for the critical paths using jest.

I have used pnpm in both frontend and backend as it is more faster than npm.

Thanks for reading this document!
